Description: It provides utilities to read, cells from complex 
    tabular data and heuristic detection based structural assignment of those 
    cells to a columnar or tidy format.
    Read functionality has the ability to read (in a unified manner) 
    structured, partially structured or unstructured tabular data (usually 
    spreadsheets for public data dissemination and aimed for common human 
    understanding) from various types of documents. The tabular information 
    is read as cells.
    The 'structure assignment' functionality has both supervised and 
    unsupervised way of assigning cells data to columnar/tidy format. 
    Multiple disconnected blocks of tables in a single sheet are also handled 
    appropriately.
    These tools are suitable for unattended conversation of (maybe a pile of)
    messy tables (like government data) into a consumable format(usable 
    for further analysis and data wrangling).
