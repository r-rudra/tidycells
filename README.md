## TL;DR

Given a `file_name` which is a path of a file that contains table(s).
Run this `read_cells()` in the R-console to see whether support is
present for the file type. If support is present, just run

``` r
read_cells(file_name)
```

**Note** Just start with a small file.

## Introduction

The package provides utilities to read, cells from complex tabular data
and heuristic detection based structural assignment of those cells to a
columnar or tidy format. Read functionality has the ability to read (in
a unified manner) structured, partially structured or unstructured
tabular data (usually spreadsheets for public data dissemination and
aimed for common human understanding) from various types of documents.
The tabular information is read as cells. The ‘structure assignment’
functionality has both supervised and unsupervised way of assigning
cells data to columnar/tidy format. Multiple disconnected blocks of
tables in a single sheet are also handled appropriately. These tools are
suitable for unattended conversation of (maybe a pile of) messy tables
(like government data) into a consumable format(usable for further
analysis and data wrangling).

## Inspiration

A spreadsheet is really flexible in storing and sharing data. Many
organizations use excel files as their fundamental medium of data
exchange (particularly in the government sector). These data are
generally not in tidy format (thanks to ultra flexibility of
spreadsheets\!). This is a great time killer for R data scientist
adopting [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) techniques. A lot of
time is spent to bring the data into a consumable or usable format
([tidy format](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)). For example, you
may check out [Database of Indian Economy](https://dbie.rbi.org.in/) (a
public data dissemination platform from [*Reserve Bank of
India*](https://www.rbi.org.in/)). This platform is a great source of
Indian economy data. However, since the target audience of this platform
is possibly common people and not data scientists, the data structure is
not suitable for ready consumption in *tidyverse* functions. This is not
only one, but there are plenty of great source of data which provides
data in *“eye-relaxing”* format rather than tidy format. Thanks to great
packages like [tidyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr),
[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl),
[unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr) (and many other sweet
packages mentioned in *reference*) which enable users to spend less time
in reshaping the data and focus more on analysis rather than data
wrangling. These packages require user interaction and decision to
transform and reshape the raw data (which is still easier than doing
*copy-paste and transpose* in excel) into the tidy format. What if, you
are given a pile of excel (or any other format of spreadsheets) which
are somehow similar but are generated by various human hands over a long
period (obviously the format and structure will change from file to
file). Or you want to build an automated forecast mechanism based on
some spreadsheet which updates periodically (possibly you may get the
updated file through some automated channel like web scraping, FTP
transfer etc.). Or simply you want something like *“I’m Feeling
Lucky”*\!

## Installation

To install the development version from GitHub you’ll need `devtools`
package in R. Assuming you have `devtools` you can install this package
in R with the following command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("r-rudra/tidycells")
```

## Getting Started

### 1\. Reading Data

Assuming you have a document(in either csv, xls, xlsx, docx, doc, html
or in pdf, *well not a scanned one*) which contains a table, read the
file directly to a tidy format (let’s refer the same as composed format)
using `read_cells` like the following
example:

``` r
fold <- system.file("extdata", "messy", package = "tidycells", mustWork = TRUE)
# this is because extension is intentionally given wrong  
# while filename is actual identifier of the file type
fcsv <- list.files(fold, pattern = "^csv.", full.names = TRUE)[1]
```

Now we simply
run

``` r
read_cells(fcsv)
```

| row | col | data\_block | value | major\_1  | major\_2 | minor\_1 | table\_tag |
| --: | --: | ----------: | :---- | :-------- | :------- | :------- | :--------- |
|   2 |   2 |           1 | 12    | Nakshatra | Weight   | Kid Name | Table\_1   |
|   3 |   2 |           1 | 16    | Titas     | Weight   | Kid Name | Table\_1   |
|   2 |   3 |           1 | 1.5   | Nakshatra | Age      | Kid Name | Table\_1   |
|   3 |   3 |           1 | 6     | Titas     | Age      | Kid Name | Table\_1   |

Not a big deal for csv though. Still let’s see how the file actually
looks like

``` r
utils::read.csv(fcsv)
```

| Kid.Name  | Weight | Age |
| :-------- | :----- | :-- |
| Nakshatra | 12     | 1.5 |
| Titas     | 16     | 6.0 |

Note that `read_cells` is neutral to file extension which means if
somehow .xls file is saved as .csv file, then also it will detect the
underlying file correctly as xls and use appreciate function to read
tabular information contained in the file. However, support for each
file types apart from csv is based on optional R packages. If you simply
type `read_cells()` in the console, it will print which file types are
supported and which package is potentially required for functionality,
those are currently not available. If any package is potentially
required, install the same and restart the R session to make that
effective. Here is a sample output:

``` r
read_cells()
```

<img src="vignettes/ext/read_cells_out.png" width="550px" />

Well, this is like “I’m feeling lucky” kind of thing. If the final
result is not what you are looking for, you may have to do some bit of
extra work. The function `read_cells` has a few layers or stages of
processing. You can choose the stage to stop processing and give
intermediate results. Then you may manipulate the intermediate result,
tune it and finally again resume processing. `read_cells` can be broken
into pieces like

``` r
d1 <- read_cells(fcsv, at_level = "va_classify") %>% 
  read_cells()
d2 <- read_cells(fcsv, at_level = 2) %>% 
  read_cells(at_level = 4) %>% 
  read_cells()
identical(d1, d2)
#> [1] TRUE
```

Now to make you understand what you can do with intermediate results,
let’s explain to you other functionalities of the package.

### 2\. Making Data *tidy*

If you have any R object `x`, you can call `as_cell_df` convert it into
a `cell-df` format (the format to store cell by cell information. See
the documentation of as\_cell\_df or cell\_df-class for more details).

``` r
x <- iris %>% head() 
cd <- x %>% as_cell_df(take_col_names = TRUE)
```

Each stored cell has an address specified by row and column and a value
(converted to a string) and a possible data type. Thus the `cell_df`
structure is defined. This is the first level of operations performed by
`read_cells`.

You can even see how the data looks by issuing plot command.

``` r
plot(cd, adaptive_txt_size = FALSE, txt_size = 2.5)
```

<img src="vignettes/ext/pr/p1.png" width="356px" />

Next task is to assign each cell into value, attribute (of those values)
and empty (irrelevant information). This is referred to in the package
as value/attribute classification (VA classification). There are main 4
alternative ways to do this apart from manually editing by hand. These
are documented in `value_attribute_classify` function. For now, we’ll
use the most useful classifier, `numeric_values_classifier`. It assumes
the cells which can be converted to a number, as values and rest as
attributes. If the cell is storing a number as a string (remember the
famous warning you may have seen in Excel about “Number Stored as Text”)
it will treat that as values. Let’s take a sample
example

``` r
dummy_dat <- tibble::tibble(name = c("Mr. X", "Mr. Y"), sal = c("1,000","12,000"), age = c(35, 60))
dummy_dat
#> # A tibble: 2 x 3
#>   name  sal      age
#>   <chr> <chr>  <dbl>
#> 1 Mr. X 1,000     35
#> 2 Mr. Y 12,000    60
dummy_dat_cells <- dummy_dat %>% 
  as_cell_df(take_col_names = TRUE) 
```

We can either do this

``` r
va_cells <- numeric_values_classifier(dummy_dat_cells)
```

Or this

``` r
va_cells <- value_attribute_classify(dummy_dat_cells, 
                                     classifier = numeric_values_classifier())
```

Let’s plot it

``` r
plot(va_cells, adaptive_txt_size = FALSE, txt_size = 3)
```

<img src="vignettes/ext/pr/p2.png" width="256px" />

Once VA classification is done, if you plot the cells you’ll notice the
color scheme is now pointed at VA classification (which is given by
`Type`) rather than cell types.

``` r
# let's resume with iris example
cd <- numeric_values_classifier(cd)
plot(cd, adaptive_txt_size = FALSE, txt_size = 2.5)
```

<img src="vignettes/ext/pr/p3.png" width="356px" />

After this stage now the `cell-df` is ready for analysis (to understand
data blocks, the orientation of attributes with respect to data or
values). This is done via the following command.

``` r
ca <- analyze_cells(cd)
```

This takes a while (the time taken is largely dependent on the
complexity of the underlying tabular structure). Once it’s done you can
plot the cell analysis and see how the heuristic detection has
performed. Currently, only interactive way is developed for possible
modifications in a cell analysis (covered in the subsequent section:
*Interactive Modules*).

``` r
plot(ca)
```

<img src="vignettes/ext/pr/p4.png" width="356px" />

Having a cell analysis at hand, the next process to perform is to
compose this cell analysis to form a composed columnar format
data.frame. This is easily done as

``` r
compose_cells(ca)
#> # A tibble: 24 x 10
#>      row   col data_block value major_1 major_2 minor_1 major_row_right~
#>    <int> <int>      <dbl> <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <chr>           
#>  1     2     1          1 5.1   setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#>  2     3     1          1 4.9   setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#>  3     4     1          1 4.7   setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#>  4     5     1          1 4.6   setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#>  5     6     1          1 5     setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#>  6     7     1          1 5.4   setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#>  7     2     2          1 3.5   setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#>  8     3     2          1 3     setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#>  9     4     2          1 3.2   setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#> 10     5     2          1 3.1   setosa  Sepal.~ Species setosa          
#> # ... with 14 more rows, and 2 more variables: major_col_top_1_1 <chr>,
#> #   minor_corner_topRight_1_1 <chr>
```

After this, you may like to see how the final data is connected or
rendered from the actual table. To do this you may run

``` r
cell_composition_traceback(ca, trace_row = 1)
cell_composition_traceback(ca, trace_row = 10)
```

<img src="vignettes/ext/pr/p5.png" width="356px" />

(Above is pre-rendered plots. You’ll get two plots.)

There is an optional interactive version of it, which is explained in
the subsequent section *Interactive Modules*.

That’s all. These are the process flow followed by `read_cells` A
half-done item can be further manipulated and after the same, we can
give it back to `read_cells` again to finish further processing (or
simply can do it ourselves). Here is a sample manipulation example.

``` r
rc_part <- read_cells(fcsv, at_level = 2)
# it is a list with `read_cells_stage` attribute
# which indicate the last processed stage in read_cells
str(rc_part)
#> List of 1
#>  $ :Classes 'cell_df', 'cells', 'rc_df', 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':   9 obs. of  4 variables:
#>   ..$ row      : int [1:9] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
#>   ..$ col      : int [1:9] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
#>   ..$ data_type: chr [1:9] "character" "character" "character" "character" ...
#>   ..$ value    : chr [1:9] "Kid Name" "Weight" "Age" "Nakshatra" ...
#>  - attr(*, "read_cells_stage")= chr "make_cells"
# sample_based_classifier is another VA classifier
# for details see coresponding documentation
rc_part[[1]] <- rc_part[[1]] %>% sample_based_classifier(empty_sample = "6")

# below should be similar to 
# rc_part[[1]] %>% 
#   analyze_cells() %>% 
#   compose_cells(discard_raw_cols = TRUE)
rc_part %>% read_cells(from_level = 3)
#> # A tibble: 1 x 10
#>     row   col data_block value major_1 major_2 minor_1 minor_2 minor_3
#>   <int> <int>      <dbl> <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <chr>  
#> 1     2     2          1 12    Naksha~ Weight  Age     Titas   Kid Na~
#> # ... with 1 more variable: table_tag <chr>
```

**A more complicated example**

Let’s take a quick look at another example data as given
in

``` r
system.file("extdata", "marks.xlsx", package = "tidycells", mustWork = TRUE)
```

The data looks like (in excel)

<img src="vignettes/ext/marks.png" width="451px" />

Let’s try our luck in this data

``` r
# if you have tidyxl installed
d <- system.file("extdata", "marks.xlsx", package = "tidycells", mustWork = TRUE) %>% 
  read_cells(at_level = "make_cells") %>% 
  .[[1]]
```

``` r
# or you may do
d <- system.file("extdata", "marks_cells.rds", package = "tidycells", mustWork = TRUE) %>% 
  readRDS()
d <- numeric_values_classifier(d)
da <- analyze_cells(d)
```

Then you need to run `compose_cells` with additional new argument
`print_attribute_overview =
TRUE`

``` r
dc <- compose_cells(da, print_attribute_overview = TRUE)
```

<img src="vignettes/ext/compose_cells_cli1.png" width="451px" />

``` r
# bit tricky and tedious unless you do print_attribute_overview = TRUE in above line
dcfine <- dc %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(name = dplyr::case_when(
    data_block == 1 ~ major_row_left_2_1,
    data_block == 2 ~ major_col_bottom_1_1,
    data_block == 3 ~ major_row_left_1_1
  ),
  sex = dplyr::case_when(
    data_block == 1 ~ major_row_left_1_1,
    data_block == 2 ~ major_col_bottom_2_1,
    data_block == 3 ~ minor_row_right_1_1
  ),
  school = dplyr::case_when(
    data_block == 1 ~ minor_col_top_1_1,
    data_block == 2 ~ minor_corner_topLeft_1_1,
    data_block == 3 ~ minor_col_top_1_1
  )) %>% 
  dplyr::select(school,sex, name, value)
```

`dcfine` looks like

| school   | sex    | name               | value |
| :------- | :----- | :----------------- | :---: |
| School A | Male   | Utsyo Roy          |  95   |
| School A | Male   | Nakshatra Gayen    |  99   |
| School A | Female | Titas Gupta        |  89   |
| School A | Female | Ujjaini Gayen      |  100  |
| School B | Male   | Indranil Gayen     |  70   |
| School B | Male   | S Gayen            |  75   |
| School B | Female | Sarmistha Senapati |  81   |
| School B | Female | Shtuti Roy         |  90   |
| School C | Male   | I Roy              |  50   |
| School C | Male   | S Ghosh            |  59   |
| School C | Female | S Senapati         |  61   |
| School C | Female | U Gupta            |  38   |

### 3\. Support for Multiple Formats

When coming to support for multiple formats (assuming you have all the
required packages as specified by `read_cells`) you can run following
set of command to test the multi-format support in `read_cells`.

``` r
dm <- tibble::tibble(fn = list.files(fold, full.names = T))
dcomps <- dm$fn %>% purrr::map(read_cells)
dcomps_sel <- dcomps %>%
    purrr::map(~ .x %>%
      dplyr::select(value, major_1, major_2))
# all of them are same [intentionaly made. but the file types are totally diffwrent]
dcomps_sel %>% purrr::map_lgl(~identical(.x, dcomps_sel[[1]]))
#> [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
# check one sample
dcomps_sel[[1]]
#> # A tibble: 4 x 3
#>   value major_1   major_2
#>   <chr> <chr>     <chr>  
#> 1 12    Nakshatra Weight 
#> 2 16    Titas     Weight 
#> 3 1.5   Nakshatra Age    
#> 4 6     Titas     Age
```

Each file is with the wrong extension and the original extension should
be the file name part before extension (intentionally created for
testing this feature). Like for example, docx.csv is actually a docx.
You can copy into some location where you have write access, then rename
appropriately and open it to verify.

### 4\. Interactive Modules

The package also provides shiny based interactive visualisations for
understanding how the heuristic is functioning and also provides object
(like `cell-df` or `cell-analysis`) editing capabilities.

The [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package is required for these
functions. Most of the features are self-explanatory and guided. Check
out interactive documentation of any of these functions listed below.
Here are screenshots of each interactive widgets.

1.  Plot tune (part of all modules)
2.  `visual_crop()` for data crop and deletion of sections

<img src="vignettes/ext/v12.png" width="516px" />

3.  `visual_va_classify()` for interactive VA classification
4.  `visual_data_block_inspection()` this shows how the heuristic has
    performed the analysis after `analyze_cells`

<img src="vignettes/ext/v34.png" width="516px" />

5.  `visual_orientation_modification()` for modification to heuristic
    based results
6.  `visual_traceback()` this is for observing how the original data is
    composed to form the final output. (`compose_cells` is called
    internally)

<img src="vignettes/ext/v56.png" width="516px" />

For each of these modules, there is a dynamic plot option available from
[plotly](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly). If you have that package
the corresponding tab will be activated. Since all of these modules are
entirely optional the dependency is kept at **tidycells** ‘suggests’
level only.

## Current State of Development and Way Forward

  - [x] Test it in [r-hub](https://builder.r-hub.io/)
  - [ ] Write more tests (increase coverage)
  - [ ] Write more vignettes on other topics
  - [ ] Releasing this package to CRAN
  - [ ] Making a pkgdown site
  - [ ] Making cell analysis little faster
  - [ ] Test for optional shiny modules (series of visual functions)
